team using Silobreaker Online s collection and analysis tools      Security Situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo        Background      The current president of the DRC is Joseph Kabila  son of the late president Laurent Kabila  who was assassinated by a bodyguard in 2001  Kabila has been in power since his father s death  His second presidential term expired in 2016  yet he has continued to delay elections  He is constitutionally barred from seeking a third term    Kabila and his relatives have financial interests in a large number of businesses within the DRC  It is speculated that Kabila s reluctance to hand over power is due to the fact that the family collectively has much to lose financially from a power transition    The president has sidelined political opposition over time  through bribery and repression  Opposition leaders  journalists  and political activists are regularly harassed by security forces loyal to the president  and jailed    Moïse Katumbi  a former ally of Kabila and previously governor of DRC s Katanga province  was exiled abroad after attempting to run in the presidential election as Kabila s opposition  After he fled the country in 2016  he was sentenced in absentia on fabricated charges of real estate fraud             Current situation      Elections are now scheduled for December 23  2018  but the delay has caused widespread outrage and protests amongst ordinary Congolese  with whom Kabila is extremely unpopular    On February 1st  2018  a spokesperson for President Kabila said the latter would respect the constitution and step down in December  as well as announce in July his preferred candidate for his succession    Considering the circumstances mentioned above  the likelihood of free and fair elections being held is remote  This is compounded by the present administration s insistence on using an electronic voting system for the first time  Member countries on the UN Security Council have raised concerns and advised against electronic voting in such a crucial election  as it is risky and could undermine credibility           New Interior Minister      In February 2018  in response to the general unrest across the country  President Kabila appointed Henri Mova Sakanyi  an administration loyalist  as interior minister  Sakanyi will oversee efforts to stabilize the security situation  which is wracked by increasing militia violence and unrest over the delayed elections           Humanitarian Crisis     Tanganyika Province Humanitarian Situation         Recent reports by aid organizations warn that a humanitarian disaster is unfolding in the country s southeast  where entrenched interethnic tensions have erupted in violence  human rights abuses and mass displacement in Tanganyika province  At least 630 000 people are currently displaced within the province  The UN Refugee Agency referred to the developing conflict between ethnic groups such as the Twa and Luba as  of extraordinary proportions   The UNHCR recorded numerous incidents in the first half of February  including 4 700 involving physical abuse  torture  killings  rape and forced labour    The province has also witnessed violent confrontation between the Congolese armed forces and militias since late January           Cholera Outbreak      According to Médecins Sans Frontières  the country is facing the worst cholera outbreak recorded in the last 20 years  In 2017 alone  55 000 people contracted cholera in the DRC  and at least 1 190 died  The epidemic has reached the capital  Kinshasa  where it is spreading due to the lack of safe drinking water  sanitation and adequate health services          Relevant Cholera outbreak articles from the DRC sourced by Silobreaker         Security Situation     Kasai Conflict       In central Kasai region  government security forces are battling an armed group who oppose Kabila s rule  Violence erupted in August 2016 when government troops killed Kamwina Nsapu  a militia leader  At least 5 000 have been killed and almost a million and half fled to neighbouring regions or Angola  Evidence of mass killings and graves dug by the Congolese Army has been reported by human rights groups             Aid Workers Killed  Abducted         In North Kivu province  two Congolese aid workers employed by the NGO Hydraulique Sans Frontières  were killed and another kidnapped by an unknown armed group  The kidnapped aid worker was released on February 19    In a statement  the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the security situation in the province  which borders both Rwanda and Uganda  is an obstacle to delivering humanitarian aid             Ituri Province Ethnic Clashes       In early February  ethnic conflict led to deaths of dozens in Ituri province in eastern DRC  Clashes between the Hema ethnic group and the rival Lendu group resulted in deaths and also in the displacement of hundreds of families  Historical tensions between the two ethnic groups have escalated recently over land and grazing rights              S  ilobreaker Hotspot tool showing areas of political instability in the DRC               Silobreaker Time series tool showing current political instability in the DRC         General Forecast for 2018         The prognosis for the DRC in 2018 is likely further instability and conflict in the run up to the scheduled election    If elections go as planned  and are held freely and fairly  Kabila would plausibly be replaced by one of the opposition figures  as he is generally unpopular  A more realistic scenario is that Kabila s government will either maintain its current hold on power  whether through Kabila or a loyalist candidate    There is also the possibility that before or after the scheduled elections  Congolese civil society may attempt  successfully or not  to overthrow the current regime  This would almost certainly be met with violent repression  as the security forces have frequently employed lethal force against even non violent protesters    Kabila s unpopularity  combined with the rapidly deteriorating socio economic conditions  could eventually result in a military coup  This could lead to political reform  or to a new  equally authoritarian  military regime    Should the instability within the DRC spill over and threaten neighbouring countries  interests  external intervention could occur  At the moment  large numbers of displaced Congolese have sought refuge in Burundi  Tanzania  Rwanda  Uganda and Angola  During the First and Second Congo Wars in the late 1990s  Angola  Uganda and Rwanda invaded and attempted to buttress or overthrow regimes within the DRC    While divided and lacking in any cohesion or unifying vision  many militia groups currently exist throughout DRC  Armed groups could potentially orchestrate a violent uprising if conditions deteriorated sufficiently    The above projections are relatively unlikely for the time being  but the current instability and uncertainty throughout the DRC means any  or a combination of the above  could occur  In any case  the humanitarian and socioeconomic situation in the short term is likely to deteriorate further rather than improve           Disclaimer     While we have made every attempt to ensure the information contained in this report has been obtained from reliable

 Silence Trojan  Ongoing attack targeting financial institutions      A new trojan has emerged in the past few days targeting financial institutions in Russia  Armenia and Malaysia    First observed by Kaspersky  the  Silence trojan  and associated threat actor s  are deploying tactics similar to those used by the  Carbanak Gang   a long established threat to the banking sector    The ongoing attacks are targeted  with hackers spending considerable time gaining access to internal networks  monitoring employees  activities and obtaining knowledge that is later used to steal funds    The initial attack vector appears to be spear phishing emails  which are often distributed from the email addresses of employees at previously compromised banks    Emails contain a  Microsoft Compiled HTML Help  file which uses JavaScript and a  VBS script to download and execute the Silence trojan    One of Silence s modules uses the Windows Graphics Device Interface and API to monitor victims by taking multiple screenshots  thereby providing a real time pseudo video stream  This tactic was also used by Carbanak    The Silence operators remain unknown  but a report from Intezer points to code

in Ukraine and Russia via fake Adobe Flash update    UPDATE 27 10          Researchers continue to investigate the   Bad Rabbit   ransomware which has been targeting countries including Russia and Ukraine since early this week      Amongst the discoveries  Cisco observed that the ransomware uses the   EternalRomance   exploit to propagate in the network  This is contrary to initial reports which claimed that unlike the NotPetya malware  Bad Rabbit did not leverage any of the alleged NSA exploits leaked by the Shadow Brokers     Separately  FireEye notes that several of the compromised sites redirecting targets to the domain that delivered the malware dropper  have also been hosting the Backswing framework  Backswing is used to collect information on a user s browsing session and send these to a C C server          UPDATE 26 10      Initially targeting Russia and Ukraine    Bad Rabbit   now reportedly infected entities in more countries including Turkey  Bulgaria and the US    Researchers continue to debate on the relationship between Bad Rabbit and the NotPetya trojan  with many claiming that the former is a new variant of the latter  This theory is based on similarities including the fact that they both use SMB to spread  create scheduled tasks to reboot the system  and share some seemingly identical functionality and code           INITIAL REPORT 25 10      Reports suggest that  Bad Rabbit  shares similarities with the  NotPetya  ransomware  It is distributed via drive by download  a method by which some popular websites have been compromised and then had malicious JS injected in their HTML body    Infected websites display a popup asking the target to download a fake Flash Player update  Once initiated  the executable locks a their machine and displays the ransom note  This redirects victims to an onion site which initially demands a 0 05 bitcoin ransom  increasing gradually until the victim pays    Bad Rabbit spreads laterally via SMB  but does not exploit  EternalBlue  like NotPetya  It drops copies of itself using its original name and executes them using Windows Management Instrumentation  WMI  and Service Control Manager Remote Protocol  Bad Rabbit also contains additional binaries such as Mimikatz to harvest credentials  and DiskCryptor to encrypt target systems    Organisations affected so far include the Kiev Metro  Odessa naval port  Odessa airport  Ukraine s ministries of infrastructure and finance  and Russian media organisations including Interfax  ESET adds that the dropper component has only been seen targeting Ukrainian organisations 12 2  of cases  65  of sightings however  have been made on occasions it has been targeting Russian organisations       Below are screenshots showcasing a typical

ransomware attacks pose to individuals and organisations has long been a concern for cyber and information security professionals  Despite this  public appreciation and understanding of this threat has traditionally been limited  At its most basic  ransomware is malware that encrypts files or locks devices  before demanding a ransom payment in return for restored functionality  If a victim chooses not to pay  their files or devices will most probably remain inoperative  Ransomware is not a new phenomenon  as a matter of fact  the first ever recorded attack dates back as far as 1989  It is  however  a threat that is gaining prominence  as we are increasingly dependent on the data stored on computer and mobile devices  This dependence has been publicly exposed this year by several high profile attacks  rendering 2017 the year that the concept and threat of ransomware truly accelerated into public consciousness         Silobreaker Time Series

Spots  Dynamic updates    Silobreaker s geo mapping tool is faster and more responsive than ever before  It now updates dynamically with new locations as you zoom in out and pan around the map  Whether you are taking a global or local view  you will be directed to the most prominent places mentioned in the data             List Import    We ve improved Lists   one of Silobreaker s core features  And now we ve made it much easier for you to create and manage lists with our new List Import tool   simply upload a CSV file with the relevant entities matched to either an existing or new list name  Whether your file contains 10 or 10 000 entities  it makes no difference  Once imported  the list will be auto populated and ready for use across Silobreaker tools             Time Series   Heat query support    We ve significantly upgraded the list search capabilities for the Time Series and Heat tools  While you can still select your existing lists from a drop down menu  we ve added a smart search field to give you more options  It is now possible to search for one or several entity types  entities within a document  or any number of lists at the same time  This allows you to track unusual activity across huge data sets  including all companies  people or organisations indexed by Silobreaker  The example below shows a Time Series search by using an entity type as the query rather than a list name             Content ingest via email    Another great addition   Silobreaker users can now import email content to their Silobreaker accounts  This feature makes it possible to set up automatic forwarding of emails  reports and other content to your Silobreaker partition  Once ingested  you will be able to view and analyse the content in Silobreaker like any other data

resources on technology that could analyse this data to help the bankers get timely and relevant client intelligence  Eventually  the bankers became frustrated by their reliance on external sources

extracting insights  It shows locations of places found in the data and by clicking on a spot you will get the evidence for why the spot is on the map     The Heat widget has been redesigned to give a less cluttered appearance  helping you see trending names and  big movers  more easily  The heat measure is an early warning tool that gauges who or what is getting more mentions in the data than usual  Silobreaker s list and heat tools are amazing time savers by supporting the use of watch lists and allowing single click queries for a whole list of entities     The Network widget has been increased to display relationships more clearly  The network auto connects terms found in the data and which are mentioned together  Connecting the dots helps you see a bigger picture outside your initial focus     YouTube is another widget that we have improved for more reliable results and better viewing in a dashboard  You can filter your searches on relevance  view count and upload date  as well as on time ranges from last hour to this month     Another new feature is that you are now in control of the locale settings for your account  including the time zone and time date format  You can also decide whether you want to see the most recent data with an actual time stamp rather than the  x mins hours ago  which we have used in the past  but which hasn t always been ideal for email alerts and other exported reports  That s it for now  but there is more stuff coming soon  Please let us know what you think                          "}}],"index":200}}
